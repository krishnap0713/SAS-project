In this SAS project, the data was cleaned and manipulated using the trailing method. Following this, the data was merged, and appropriate statistical tests, including the SURVEYSELECT procedure with the Simple Random Sampling (SRS) method, were performed to obtain the desired results. Additionally, Pearson correlation and the UNIVARIATE procedure were utilized to further analyze the data and derive the final results.
